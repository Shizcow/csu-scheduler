# Want to use this for your college?  
A lot of work has been done to make this easily adaptable to other institutions.  
In order to do so, fork and rename [csu-scheduler](https://github.com/Shizcow/csu-scheduler), the source repo.   
In config.js there are some instructions on how to get started. Read through each section and follow the instructions.
After that, little source modification will be required. Direct any questions to csu-scheduler maintainers.
